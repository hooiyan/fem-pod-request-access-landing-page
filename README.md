## My process

### Built with

- BEM naming convention
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [How to change background-image opacity in CSS without affecting text | HTML/CSS](https://coder-coder.com/background-image-opacity/) - This helped me in making the background overlay
- [CSS Tutorial For Beginners 46 - Multiple Backgrounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sj7Hs94uZjE) - Shaun's awesome. I always love his teaching style. I learned from this video that we can actually put multiple images in `background-image` which is amazing! We can then position those images easily using `background-position` too.

### Continued Development

For this challenge, my main focus is HTML & CSS. I would like to improve the JavaScript form validation in the future. For now, it only validates if the user enters anything in the textbox, or whether the user has entered an email with an `@` in it.
